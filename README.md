To create a README file for your Pandas-Exercise repository, you'll want to provide useful information about the purpose of the repository, how to use it, and any other relevant details. Below is an example template for a README.md file tailored to a Pandas exercise repository:

# Pandas Exercise

This repository contains exercises and examples for practising data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas library in Python.

## Overview

The exercises are organized into different directories based on topics such as data loading, cleaning, exploration, and manipulation using Pandas. Each directory contains Jupyter Notebook files (*.ipynb) with exercises and corresponding datasets (*.csv, *.xlsx, etc.) for practising various Pandas functionalities.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ahammadnafiz/Pandas-Exercise.git
   cd Pandas-Exercise
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   It's recommended to create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:
   ```
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore the Exercises**:
   Navigate to the relevant directory containing exercises (e.g., `01_Getting_&_Knowing_Your_Data`, `02_Filtering_&_Sorting`, etc.) and open the Jupyter Notebook file (*.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Complete Exercises**:
   Follow the instructions within the Jupyter Notebook to complete the exercises and practice Pandas functionalities.
